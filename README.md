# Download CurseForge Minecraft Mod Packs on Linux

***DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO WORK RELIABLY!***

You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed for this.

All you have to do is `node install_pack.js https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/MODPACK_NAME_HERE` and follow the instructions!

You'll also need to have `unzip` installed on your system. (to avoid npm dependencies for this script)
